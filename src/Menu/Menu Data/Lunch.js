    "lDesc": 'Fufu, one of West and Central Africas famous foods, has a complex preparation process. And it definitely ranks top of the  African food menu. They make it by pounding unripe plantains and cassava using a large wooden pole, then mashing the mixture while adding water. Upon smoothening, they then roll it into small balls. Since fufu has a bland taste and a gummy texture, it goes with light soup (made of fish or meat). The soups can be palm nut soup or groundnut soup for added spiciness.',
